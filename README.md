## Introduction

Taking problems mostly from Cameron Davidson Pilon's [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
and Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models),
I'm using [Figaro](https://github.com/p2t2/figaro) to solve them.
